Abstract: This project expands on Junwei Chen's seminal work, "Analysis of Bitcoin Price Prediction Using Machine Learning," by reproducing and extending its methodology, which employs Random Forest Regression and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for predicting Bitcoin prices. Our study spans from March 31, 2015, to April 1, 2022, and collects 47 variables across diverse categories, including Bitcoin's market behavior, technical aspects, comparative cryptocurrency data, and broader economic indicators. We meticulously replicate Chen's methodology to establish a benchmark upon which we build by introducing new data preprocessing techniques and models to elevate predictive accuracy. Our replication aligns closely with the original findings, while our enhancements provide a more nuanced understanding of the Bitcoin market dynamics and improved predictive performance. Our enhanced XGBoost model demonstrates the best accuracy among all models and differential/log differential datasets. This paper contributes to the fintech field by deepening the understanding of Bitcoin price determinants and refining the approaches used in cryptocurrency market analysis.
